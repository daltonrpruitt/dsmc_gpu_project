Example Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) program.  Use this
program as a guide to your parallel implementation.  You may use this
code if you wish, but it is also desirable if you find other more
efficient implementations.  The code outputs particles and average cell data
files in the files particles.dat and cells.dat.  A helper program, pextract,
is provided that can extract the particle data to allow it to be plotted using
a 2-D plotting package.

The program can be run in either 2D or 3D modes.  By default it solves
in the 3-d mode with 32x32x32 grid and about 10 particles per cell at
the inflow.  The goal is to solve on at least a 128x128x128 grid using
a parallel implementation.
